_printf

.SH DESCRIPTION

The _printf function is short for "print formatted. It operates in a manner similar to the standard printf function by formatting and presenting data. It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments to be printed.
When printf processes its arguments, it begins by sequentially printing each character found in the first argument. However, when it encounters a percent sign (%), it recognizes this as a format specifier and moves on to the next argument, using its value to print it in accordance with the specified format. After this, printf resumes printing the remaining characters from the first argument. It is possible to include multiple format specifiers in the printf string, in which case each specifier corresponds to a specific argument in the order they are given.
